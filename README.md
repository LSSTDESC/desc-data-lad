# desc_data_lad

This is a prototype of a DESC tool for managing data produced as part of our science analyses.

It will link to a NERSC space which will act as the offical central repository, but allows local mirrors of (subdirectories of) this space.

See https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RequestForComments/issues/13 for some early discussion.
